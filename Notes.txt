Object Oriented Programming

Modeling
- Representation of reality
- Which features is enough to simplify the model, but not make it too complicated?

Encapsulation
- Keeping data and operations with in their models
- models should be specific and not deal with things outside its scope

Classes
- C++ construct for models
- Include data and funcitons
- An instance of a class is known as an Object
- Code has public, private, and protected members
    - public: any Code
    - private: only inside the class
    - protected: inherited classes
- Inheritcance
    - subclass inherit members form the superclass
Polymorphism
    - subclasses implement something differently than the version they inherited
    - makes the sibling classes polymorphic

C++ is case sensitive

main function must return an integer

IO
- all need "std:" then the arrows 
- <<
    - cout: character output
    - endl: end line (inputs newline)
    - flush: ensures the output has completely been sent to the terminal before waiting for the user input (doesn't input new line)
- >>
    - cin: character input
        - only works for single words
-
